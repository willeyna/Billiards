# Billiard Bounces in 2D Boundaries 

This project began on  1-17-2022 as a simple curiosity-founded personal project to analyze bounded 2D collisions and the patterns or chaotic motion that may be produced.
Prior to starting work on this I had not read any literature on the topic and have approached this as a 'discorvery' project, coming up with the algorithms used at every step. As such, most methods used may not be optimal. Instead of optimization this project focused on "inventing" the process. 

Goals of the project: 
  * Create script that can model a sequence of N bounces given any differentiable boundary f(x,y) with derivative dy/dx = f'(x)
  * Plot and qualitatively analyze the motion of billiards in basic circular and elliptical boundaries 
  * Understand and analyze poincare maps of the motion to understand chaotic or non-chaotic motion
  * Analyze all such parts for more complex boundaries like cardiods
